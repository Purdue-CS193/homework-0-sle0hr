# Seth Leohr's First CS193 Homework
My Favorite things about CS193
- There is no exams
- The course isn't rushed and pressured
- The TAs are nice and chill people
- I feel comfortable in the class and don't feel lost
- I love how the class only meets once a week
```
This is how you print out code
System.out.println("hello World")

```

*Is this how you ittalize*
